# Yenaldooshi
Do you have an old mining GPU that you need resurrecting? Is fighting windows updates and having to reset registry keys bringing you down?

This is a bash scripts to get a P106-100 working in Pop-OS 20.04 for vulkan and openGL gaming.

Yenaldooshi is currently tested in a virtual machine with SPICE as the video output for the mining card. Further testing is needed to see if this is needed for pre-haskwell igpus or amd gpus.
